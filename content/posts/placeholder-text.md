Hi there 👋, I’m Jonas Steinhauser. Geek & Developer.

I’m always on the lookout for the next challenge, whether in programming or other areas of interest. My hobbies include coding 🧑‍💻, music 🎺, spending time with friends and family, and riding my motorcycle 🏍️.

Currently, I work at Airbus Defence and Space as a Software Developer for C4ISR systems. C4ISR stands for command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance. Essentially, it focuses on connecting all command information systems to create a more comprehensive situational awareness, ultimately enhancing decision-making and leadership capabilities. This field is fascinating because it involves analyzing input data from a variety of sources. Technologies like IoT, Big Data, and Data Science might play a significant role in this area in the future.

In my free time, I enjoy diving into new and interesting topics. During my studies, I gained experience through projects involving automated anomaly/situation detection and object detection. I’ll discuss these projects further in future blog posts.

Looking forward to it – see you soon. Cheers 👋
