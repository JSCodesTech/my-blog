# Servus üëã

I am currently starting a new research project focused on **sensor fusion for object detection and localization in indoor environments**. In this blog, I will document the entire development process and share my progress.

## Who am I?

I am currently pursuing an **M.Sc. in Artificial Intelligence at RWU**, focusing on **object detection, sensor fusion, and AI-based data analysis**.

## Why this project?

The combination of different sensor data enables more accurate environmental models. My goal is to explore how **multiple sensors can be efficiently fused** to achieve reliable object detection and positioning.

## The Plan: Two Phases (Initial Draft)

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Scientific Project
- Setup and synchronization of hardware (cameras, LiDAR, additional sensors).
- Initial tests on sensor data fusion and dataset creation.
- Development of a basic system for object detection and positioning.
- Evaluation and documentation of results in a research paper.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Master‚Äôs Thesis
- Expansion to a multi-sensor system with multiple cameras.
- Investigation and implementation of different fusion strategies.
- Enhancement of accuracy and efficiency in position estimation.
- Extensive testing and documentation in a master‚Äôs thesis.

## Challenges & Open Questions

1. **Multi-Sensor Calibration**: How precisely can sensor data be synchronized and fused?
2. **Choosing the Right Fusion Strategy**: Which method delivers the best results?
3. **Computation & Optimization**: How can processing efficiency be improved?

I will address these questions step by step in this blog and share my findings.

## Why Document Everything Publicly?

I believe that **open research and knowledge sharing** are extremely valuable. Therefore, I will regularly share my progress, challenges, and solutions here. If you're interested in this topic or have ideas for improvement ‚Äì feel free to reach out!

I look forward to sharing this journey with you. See you soon!
